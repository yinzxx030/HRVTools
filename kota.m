%kota - QRS detection using Hilbert Transform
% Detects the location of R-peaks using the algorithm described by Kota &
% al.
%
% Process:
%   1. High-Pass filtering
%   2. Half-Wave rectifier
%   3. Moving average (150ms)
%   4. Moving window integration
%   5. Find the instantaneous phase using the Hilbert Transform
%   6. Find the R-Peak between each phase slip
%
%
% Inputs:
%    sig - The preprocessed signal
%    detrended - The detrended signal
%
% Outputs:
%    R_loc - Array with the R-Peak locations
